## What I did today
- Set up GitHub Desktop
- Cloned the secure-auth-snippets repository
- Learned how commit and push work

## Notes
- Commit = saves changes locally
- Push = sends changes to GitHub
- One push per day = one green square 🟩

## Next step
- Add a small Java or Python security snippet
