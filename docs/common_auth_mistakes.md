# Common Authentication Mistakes

## 1. Storing passwords in plaintext
Plaintext passwords expose all users if breached.

---

## 2. Hardcoding credentials
Credentials should never be part of source code.

---

## 3. Weak password policies
Short or simple passwords weaken security even with hashing.

---

## 4. Detailed error messages
Error messages like "User not found" help attackers.

---

## 5. No brute-force protection
Unlimited login attempts allow password guessing.
