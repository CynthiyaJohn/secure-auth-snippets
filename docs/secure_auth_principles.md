# Secure Authentication Principles

- Never store or log plaintext passwords
- Always use strong hashing with salt
- Keep secrets outside source code
- Use constant-time comparisons
- Limit login attempts
- Prefer generic error messages

Security is about **eliminating entire attack classes**, not patching bugs.
