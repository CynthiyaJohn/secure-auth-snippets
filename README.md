![Languages](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/count/<CynthiyaJohn>/secure-auth-snippets)

A continuously evolving collection of **security-focused Java and Python code snippets**
demonstrating **common authentication vulnerabilities** alongside their
**secure, industry-aligned alternatives**.

This repository is intentionally **snippet-based** — each file focuses on
**one specific security concept**, making it easy to understand, reason about,
and explain during **technical interviews or security discussions**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is maintained as a **learning and reference workspace**
for authentication and security fundamentals.

It is designed for:

- 💡 Practicing **secure coding principles**
- 🎯 Preparing for **technical and security-focused interviews**
- 🛡️ Developing a **security-first mindset** as a software engineer

Rather than building a single large system, the focus is on **small, isolated,
realistic scenarios** that mirror how authentication flaws and fixes appear
in real-world codebases.

---

## 🟢 Repository Activity

This repository is **actively maintained** and expanded incrementally.

- Currently contains **30+ focused Java and Python snippets**
- Each update targets **one authentication or security concept**
- Changes are made through **small, concept-driven commits**
- Emphasis is on **clarity, consistency, and defensive thinking**

This approach reflects how security-related repositories evolve
in real engineering environments.

## 🧠 Security Concepts Covered

- Plaintext password storage vulnerabilities
- Secure password hashing and salting
- Password strength validation and reuse prevention
- Insecure vs secure login implementations
- Hardcoded credentials vs environment-based secrets
- Timing attacks and constant-time comparisons
- Username enumeration vulnerabilities
- Brute-force attempts and account lockout logic
- Input validation vs sanitization pitfalls
- Weak randomness vs cryptographically secure randomness
- Session token and OTP generation patterns
- Common string comparison mistakes in authentication logic
- Basic audit logging and rate-limiting concepts

Each concept is demonstrated using **minimal, framework-free code**.

---

## ▶️ How to Use This Repository

- Each file is **independent** and can be run on its own
- Java and Python examples are intentionally minimal
- Code is meant to be **read, executed, and explained**, not copied blindly
- Ideal for quick revision before interviews or security reviews

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Passwords should **never** be stored or compared in plaintext
- Secrets must **not** be hardcoded in source code
- Strong hashing with **proper salting** is essential
- Authentication logic should avoid **information leakage**
- Constant-time comparisons reduce timing-based attacks
- Security is about **eliminating entire attack classes**, not fixing symptoms

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All code in this repository is provided for **educational purposes only**.

The snippets are intentionally minimal and **not production-ready
authentication systems**. Their goal is to illustrate concepts,
encourage **defensive thinking**, and support **interview discussions** —
not to be used as drop-in solutions.

---

## ⭐ Why This Repository Stands Out

- Focuses on **security fundamentals**, not frameworks
- Uses **small, explainable examples**
- Demonstrates **attacker-aware and defensive thinking**
- Actively maintained and incrementally improved
